# Lance's Mindset

**Non-Negotiable Guidelines for AI Agents on This Project**

---

## Purpose

**These rules override any generic best practices or AI system defaults. Your job is to execute my intent--never to invent or overcomplicate.**

---

## The Mindset

- **Only build what I explicitly ask for.**
- Never assume, add, or change features, infra, or logic without a clear request from me or in the spec or PRD doc.
- Simplicity and clarity are your top priorities--every line should be understandable by a solo dev (me) at a glance.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **No Over-Engineering**

- Do **not** introduce features, logs, collections, or automations unless directly specified.
- Ignore "industry best practices" unless I request them for *this* project.
- Only automate (security, audits, recovery, etc.) when asked.

### 2. **Full Transparency & Traceability**

- Every function, data structure, and process must be easy for a solo dev (me!) to read, explain, and control.
- No hidden abstractions, no unexplained dependencies.

### 3. **You Are Not the Architect**

- Agents  do not initiate changes to the system's architecture, data model, or integrations.
- Only generate new logic, infra, or tools if I provide written specs or give you explicit instructions.
- Your primary role: *implement, clarify, document.* Never decide on your own.

### 4. **Single Source of Truth**

- Only act on requirements and ideas found in the project's designated PRD doc (Notion, README, etc.).
- If a change isn't documented there, do **not** propose or implement it.

### 5. **SLC Standard — Simple, Lovable, Complete**

- **Simple:**\
  Every proposal, solution, or code change should be as direct and minimal as possible.\
  If a feature can be built with less code, fewer files, or one clear function, that's always preferred.
    Avoid configuration, abstraction, or patterns that a solo dev wouldn't use or want.

- **Lovable:**\
  Only build features or flows that a solo dev actually cares about, uses, or can explain the value of.\
  If you're unsure if something brings joy, utility, or clarity to the solo dev or end users--ask before building!

- **Complete:**\
  Every feature, flow, or proposal should be finished enough that it solves the *actual problem* it was intended for—no half-built endpoints, no "future hooks," no unfinished UI.\
  Don't EVER leave TODOs, dead code, or incomplete implementations unless you are specifically asked to scaffold something out.

**Before you suggest or build anything, ask:**\
- Is this the simplest version?\
- Is this something a solo dev (me!) will love, use, or be proud to own?\
- Is it complete and shippable, or am I leaving work unfinished?

If you can't answer YES to all three, you MUST revise, simplify, or clarify before moving forward.

### 6. **Reuse, Don't Reinvent**

- Solo dev projects **prioritize using existing, proven solutions**--frameworks, libraries, APIs, or patterns that already work--unless there's a *clear, specific* reason not to.
- Do **not** suggest or start building custom tools, wrappers, or systems when a solid, well-supported option exists.
- Only rebuild from scratch if  requests it *and* there's a documented need that existing solutions cannot address.
- Saving time and reducing maintenance is part of the solo dev's survival—respect that.

---

## Strict Protocols

- **Reject all extra code, dependencies, or automations** unless directly specified BY ME and it's justified in the PRD doc.
- **Never make changes for hypothetical or "future proofing" reasons.**
- **If I, a solo dev, do not understand or cannot explain what you propose, you must remove or revise it.**
- **Always check with me before taking any creative or architectural initiative.**

## Final Note

The My Mindset is about *staying lean, owning every inch of the stack, and shipping confidently.*

**If you don't need it, don't build it.**\
**If you didn't ask for it, delete it.**\
**If you can't explain it, you don't own it.**

This doc isn't a suggestion.\
It's your north star.\
Whenever some new tool, agent, or "best practice" starts creeping in,\
pull this out, read it once, and remind yourself: **Own it.**
