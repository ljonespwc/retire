**Steps:**
1. Entered pension income: $40,000
2. Verified two checkboxes appeared:
   - "Indexed to inflation (cost-of-living adjustments)"
   - "Has bridge benefit (reduces by $16,374 at age 65)"

**Result:** Both checkboxes rendered correctly when pension income was entered.

**Screenshot Evidence:**

### Test 10: Verify Calculation Engine Applies Bridge Reduction
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Method:** Direct TypeScript engine testing
**Test Scenario:**
- Current Age: 55
- Retirement Age: 60 (early retirement to test bridge)
- Pension: $40,000/year starting at age 60
- Indexed to inflation: YES
- Bridge benefit: YES ($16,374 reduction at age 65)

**Engine Test Results:**

#### Year-by-Year Pension Income:
| Age | Pension Amount | Calculation |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 64  | $43,297.29    | $40k × 1.02^4 |
| 65  | $27,789.23    | ($40k × 1.02^5) - $16,374 |
| 66  | $28,672.50    | ($40k × 1.02^6) - $16,374 |

#### Bridge Reduction Logic Verified:
1. **Before Age 65:** Pension grows with inflation (2% annually)
   - Age 64: $40,000 × 1.02^4 = $43,297.29 ✅

2. **At Age 65:** Bridge reduction applied
   - Base pension: $40,000 × 1.02^5 = $44,163.23
   - Bridge reduction: -$16,374.00 (FIXED amount)
   - Final pension: $27,789.23 ✅

3. **After Age 65:** Pension continues indexing, bridge remains fixed deduction
   - Base pension: $40,000 × 1.02^6 = $45,046.50
   - Bridge reduction: -$16,374.00 (FIXED amount)
   - Final pension: $28,672.50 ✅

**Key Finding:** The engine correctly implements the bridge benefit as a **fixed dollar deduction**, not an inflation-adjusted amount. The base pension amount is indexed to inflation, then the fixed $16,374 is subtracted each year after age 65.

**Test Output:**
```
✅ PASS: Bridge benefit reduction applied correctly!
   Age 64 pension: $43297.29
   Age 65 pension (before bridge): $44163.23
   Age 65 pension (after bridge): $27789.23
   Bridge reduction: $16374.00 (fixed amount)

✅ PASS: Pension indexing continues correctly after bridge reduction!
   Age 65: $27789.23
   Age 66: $28672.50 (expected $28672.50)
   Logic: Base pension ($40k) grows with inflation, bridge ($16374) is fixed deduction
```

## Code Coverage

### UI Components Tested
- ✅ `FormSections.tsx` (src/components/calculator/FormSections.tsx:226-270)
  - Pension income field
  - Indexed to inflation checkbox
  - Bridge benefit checkbox
  - Disabled state validation
  - Helper text display

### Database Layer Tested
- ✅ `scenarios` table schema (Supabase)
  - `inputs.income_sources.pension.indexed_to_inflation`
  - `inputs.income_sources.pension.has_bridge_benefit`
  - `inputs.income_sources.pension.bridge_reduction_amount`
  - `inputs.income_sources.pension.bridge_reduction_age`

### Scenario Mapping Tested
- ✅ `formDataToScenario()` (src/lib/scenarios/scenario-mapper.ts:48-138)
  - Maps form checkboxes → database pension object
  - Handles bridge benefit conditional fields

- ✅ `scenarioToFormData()` (src/lib/scenarios/scenario-mapper.ts:143-179)
  - Maps database pension object → form checkboxes
  - Backward compatibility handling

### Calculation Engine Tested
- ✅ `calculateRetirementProjection()` (src/lib/calculations/engine.ts:44)
  - Year-by-year pension income projection
  - Inflation indexing logic
  - Bridge reduction application at age 65
  - Continued indexing after bridge reduction

---

## Edge Cases Tested

### 1. Bridge Benefit Minimum Validation
**Scenario:** Pension < $16,374
**Expected:** Checkbox disabled
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Checkbox disables with helper text

### 2. Retirement Age = Bridge Reduction Age
**Scenario:** Retire at 65, bridge reduces at 65
**Expected:** Pension starts with bridge already applied
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Pension = $23,626 at age 65 ($40k - $16,374)

### 3. Early Retirement (before age 65)
**Scenario:** Retire at 60, bridge reduces at 65
**Expected:** Full pension 60-64, reduced pension 65+
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Verified with year-by-year test

### 4. Pension Indexing After Bridge
**Scenario:** Indexed pension with bridge benefit
**Expected:** Base pension grows with inflation, fixed $16,374 subtracted each year
**Result:** ✅ PASS - Age 66 pension matches expected: ($40k × 1.02^6) - $16,374

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Bridge Benefit Inflation Handling
**Current Behavior:** Bridge reduction amount ($16,374) is a FIXED dollar amount
**Real-World Consideration:** Some pension plans may index the bridge benefit itself
**Impact:** Low - Most public sector pensions use fixed bridge amounts
**Recommendation:** Document this assumption in help text

### 2. Help Text Update Needed
**Location:** `src/lib/calculator/help-tips.ts:73-77`
**Current Text:**
> "**Bridge Benefit:** Some pensions include a temporary supplement (often ~$16K) that reduces when you turn 65..."

**Suggested Addition:**
> "The $16,374 reduction is a fixed dollar amount that does not adjust for inflation. If your pension is indexed, the base amount will continue to grow, but the bridge reduction remains constant."
